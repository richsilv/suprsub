			<p>SuprSub is a player to player exchange, helping teams to find a last minute player and hungry SuprSubs to find more games.</p>
			<h4>3 Easy Steps:</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Teams find last minute players by tweeting how many, when and where you need them to <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=suprsub">@suprsub</a>, or posting via <a href="www.suprsub.com">www.suprsub.com</a>. We repost this to our large and growing SuprSub community.</li>
				<li>Players find games by registering when and where they are available, and we will notify you when there is a match OR just follow our stream <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=suprsub">@suprsub on Twitter</a> or at <a href="www.suprsub.com">www.suprsub.com</a>.</li>
				<li>When you match, we put you in contact directly to finalise the details.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>So go on then! Be a SuprSub. Find a SuprSub.  Play more football!</p>

				<p>5-a-side, 11-a-side and everything in between.  Play more football!</p>
				<p>SuprSub provides an easy way of posting last minute player needs to a large and growing community of eager footballers.  By last minute we mean anytime in the next week, from a few hours to a few days.</p>
				<p>Look for a player by tweeting the @suprsub account, using the #suprsub hashtag or use the “make a posting now” box on the website detailing number of players needed, location, day and time.</p>
				<p>Teams can save their regular games on www.suprsub.com meaning they can search for a player in one click</p>
				<p>We ensure all the details are correct (especially pitch location) and then release the request to our SuprSub community on Twitter, Facebook and Web.  If it matches a registered player’s availability, they are sent a push notification.  All this should take a few seconds.</p>
				<p>Keen players register their availability as a SuprSub at www.suprsub.com detailing where and when they are willing to play.  Choose how you wish to be notified when a team needs you.  Or just follow our feed and pick a game when and where it suits you.</p>
				<p>When SuprSub matches a team and player, the two parties are put in contact to arrange the finer details of the game (exact meeting point, what colour to wear, what surface you will play on, are shin pads mandatory etc).</p>
				<p>If you are a team in need of a spare player or two, SuprSub allows you to reach a big network of eager players in your local area in seconds.</p>
				<p>If you are someone who just loves to play football, SuprSub gives you the opportunity to get more games by filling in for teams that are short as often as you want.</p>
				<p>We at SuprSub will assume that everything always works out well.  But if it doesn’t for any reason, please report abuse/no-shows/cancelled games and any and all unwanted behaviour to admin@suprsub.com</p>
